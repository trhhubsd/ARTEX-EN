## Approval Record Details

Global "Approval Records" and task‑level "Intercept Approvals" as well as approval cards in conversations can be expanded to view details. The structure follows the component used in [AegisHook's approval detail component](https://github.com/RuoJi6/AegisHook/blob/main/web/src/components/CallDetail.vue), using ARTEX's component and theme.

---

## Asset Synchronization (ScopeSentry)

Supports direct synchronization of asset data from [ScopeSentry](https://github.com/Autumn-27/ScopeSentry), eliminating duplicate collection:
- On the **Asset Sync** page, enter the ScopeSentry address and API Key to connect the data source.
- Choose synchronization targets and asset types (domains / subdomains / IPs / ports / sites / endpoints…) by **Project** or **Task**.
- Import with one click and merge according to company asset scope, making the assets directly usable in ARTEX's asset graph for agents.

## Installation

> Requires **PostgreSQL** database; configure **LLM** (set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, also configurable via UI).

### Method 1: One‑Click Install Script (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Autumn-27/ARTEX.git
cd ARTEX
./install.sh
```
The script will:
- Detect / automatically install Docker → let you choose **① Full Docker** or **② Local Build**:
  - **① Full Docker**: Provide a Postgres password (Enter to generate random) → automatically write `.env` → `docker compose up -d`.
  - **② Local Build**: Choose a database (existing or Docker‑started) → generate `config.json` → compile the Go binary → start.
After installation, open **http://localhost:8787** (first visit go to `/setup` to set admin password).

### Method 2: Docker Compose (manual)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Autumn-27/ARTEX.git
cd ARTEX
cp .env.example .env          # fill POSTGRES_PASSWORD, optional ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d          # pulls autumn27/artex image + postgres
# → http://localhost:8787
```
The image includes common tools (ripgrep, curl, vim, npm, nmap…). `./skills` and `./data` are mounted for persistence.

### Remote MCP Configuration

You can select `http` (Streamable HTTP) or `sse` (legacy SSE) in system settings. SSE services typically use `GET /sse` to establish an event stream, then receive JSON‑RPC requests via `/message?sessionId=...`. Configure the URL as `/sse` and set the `Authorization=Bearer <token>` header.

### Method 3: Download Pre‑compiled Binaries (Releases)

Download the appropriate zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/Autumn-27/ARTEX/releases) page, unzip to obtain `artex` + `start.sh` (Windows: `start.bat`) + `skills/` + `config.example.json`:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json   # fill database connection
./start.sh                           # → http://localhost:8787
```
> Use `start.sh` / `start.bat` to launch; do not run `./artex` directly. It is a daemon script: when the program exits, the exit code decides whether to restart. The "one‑click update" button on the page relies on this script.
> Background daemon example: `nohup ./start.sh >artex.log 2>&1 &`.

### Method 4: Build from Source (single binary)

```bash
# Frontend static export
cd web && npm ci && npm run build:static && cd ..
# Copy into embedded directory
cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
# Compile (use -tags embedui to embed frontend)
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embedui -o artex ./cmd/artex
./start.sh
```

### Method 5: Cross‑Platform Release Package

`build.sh` builds and embeds the frontend, then strips debugging info and compresses the release zip. Release mode generates Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 zip packages:
```bash
./build.sh --release
# Output: dist/artex-0.3.3-*.zip
```
UPX self‑extracting binaries may be incompatible with some Linux kernels, virtualization environments, or security policies, so it is disabled by default. You can enable it with `ARTEX_TARGETS` and `--upx` when you have confirmed compatibility.

---

## Update & Upgrade

> Upgrading replaces the program without touching data: PostgreSQL volume `pgdata`, `./data` (jwt.key / SQLite etc.), and `./skills` are preserved. **Database migrations are automatic** – each start runs `schema.sql` idempotently (adds columns, creates indexes if not existing).

### Method 1: One‑Click Update via UI (recommended)

In the **System Settings** page (sidebar → `/system/settings`), the **Version & Update** card lets you check for and install new versions without logging into the server.
- Click **Update** → download the current platform's release → compare `SHA256SUMS` → smoke‑test the new binary → stage as `artex.new` → the program exits, and `start.sh` / `start.bat` automatically restarts with the new version.
- **Failure handling**: If verification or smoke test fails, the staged file is discarded and the current version continues. If the new version fails to start three consecutive times, it rolls back to `artex.old` (the failed binary remains as `artex.failed` for debugging).
- **Rollback**: The previous version is kept as `artex.old`; you can revert via the UI. Database schema does not revert.
- **Note**: Updates interrupt running tasks – perform during idle periods.
- **Docker**: Updating the container only replaces the binary, not the embedded tools; after `docker compose up -d` the container will revert to the original image versions. Use `docker compose pull artex && docker compose up -d artex` to update the image as well.
- **Proxy**: If GitHub requires a proxy, configure a **global proxy** on the same page; updates will go through it.

### Method 2: One‑Click Update Script

```bash
cd ARTEX
./update.sh
```
The script optionally runs `git pull` then lets you choose **① Docker Update** or **② Local Build Update** (mirroring `install.sh`):
- **① Docker**: Specify target image tag (Enter to use `.env`'s `ARTEX_TAG`, default `latest`) → `docker compose pull` → `docker compose up -d` (docker image swap triggers migration).
- **② Local**: Rebuild frontend static assets → re‑compile `./artex` (changes take effect after restart).

### Method 3: Manual Docker Compose Update

```bash
cd ARTEX
git pull                       # update compose / scripts (optional)
# Specify version: set ARTEX_TAG=v0.2.0 in .env, otherwise defaults to latest
docker compose pull artex
docker compose up -d artex     # swap image & restart → automatic schema migration
docker image prune -f          # optional cleanup of old images
```

### Method 4: Pre‑compiled Binary (Releases)

Download the new zip from [Releases], stop the old process, replace `artex` and `skills/` (keep your `config.json` and `data/`), then restart:
```bash
cp -r <extracted>/skills ./ && cp <extracted>/artex ./
./start.sh
```

### Method 5: Build from Source

```bash
git pull
cd web && npm ci && npm run build:static && cd ..
cp -r web/out server/webui/dist
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags embedui -o artex ./cmd/artex
# Restart
./start.sh
```

---

## Configuration

**Database** (`config.json` or via `ARTEX_PG_DSN` env):
```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "artex",
    "password": "yourpass",
    "dbname": "artex",
    "sslmode": "disable"
  }
}
```
**LLM**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`), also configurable in the UI's **LLM Configuration** page.
Optional: `ARTEX_LLM_PROVIDER`, `ARTEX_LLM_MODEL`, `ARTEX_LLM_BASE_URL`, `ARTEX_LLM_PROXY`.
**Concurrency**: Number of workers per task is configurable in **System Settings** (default 3).
**Common Parameters**: `./start.sh -addr :8787 -proxy :8788` (pass directly to `artex`).

### Reverse Proxy Deployment (HTTPS / expose only 443)

Both frontend and API/SSE share the same backend port (default `:8787`). Real‑time activity stream uses the same origin, so **no need to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_BASE`**. Expose only 443 externally and keep 8787 internal.
SSE requires disabling buffering; otherwise browsers may connect but receive no events. Nginx example:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your.domain.com;
    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key ...

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        # SSE critical settings:
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
    }
}
```
Only set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SSE_BASE` during build if SSE must use a different origin.

## Development

### Manual Vulnerability Re‑testing

The "Re‑test" tab on a task’s vulnerability detail page allows pagination to select vulnerabilities, view historical conclusions/evidence, and manually launch a re‑test. After starting, the tab shows a loading spinner and "Re‑testing" status. Once a fix is confirmed, the vulnerability status updates automatically.
- Click "Re‑test" on a vulnerability row or in the detail section to open a dedicated re‑test Agent session.
- New builds include a pre‑configured "retester" Agent (`retester`) which can be customized in Agent Management (prompt, LLM, budget, tools).
- When a re‑test session finishes with "Fixed", the vulnerability state changes to "Fixed" automatically.

### Local Run & Test

```bash
./dev.sh    # backend (:8787) + traffic proxy (:8788) + frontend next dev (:5173) → http://localhost:5173
```
- Backend: `go run ./cmd/artex` (omit `-tags embedui` to not embed frontend).
- Frontend: `cd web && npm run dev` (API proxied to backend, hot reload).
- Tests: `go test ./...`
- Mock preview (no backend): `cd web && NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=1 npm run dev`

## System Architecture

ARTEX is an **LLM‑driven autonomous penetration testing system**: Go monolith backend (embedding Next.js frontend) + PostgreSQL. Agent capabilities come from the [`norma`](https://github.com/Autumn-27/norma) SDK (`agentcore`, `tool`, `permission`, `harness`, `memory`, `transcript`). The core features a **dual‑graph architecture** and two autonomous mechanisms:
- **Worker‑level process‑level information exchange**
- **Planner multi‑round shared todolist for stable attack chains**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js static export, embedded via `go:embed`; visualizes tasks, assets, exploration graph, coverage map, human‑in‑the‑loop dialogue |
| **Server** | `net/http` routing, JWT auth, SSE; `Manager` hosts task, engine, DB store lifecycle |
| **Engine** | Per‑task `plannerLoop` + N worker goroutines; intent retrieval, timeout/pause/drain |
| **Agent** | Goals / Planner / Worker / MainAgent; `ToolSet` exposes dual‑graph to LLM tools |
| **DB** | Dual‑graph persisted in Postgres; schema rebuilt idempotently on each start |
| **Support** | MITM proxy, approval gate, async enrichment, MCP/skills/memory/report |

### Dual‑Graph Architecture
- **Asset Graph** (global shared): Nodes represent `root_domain / subdomain / ip / service / app / endpoint`, grouped by company. Parent‑child relationships and deduplication keys are computed automatically.
- **Exploration Graph** (per‑task): Nodes represent `goal / intent / fact / finding / hint`; edges (`spawns`, `derived_from`, `yields`, `proves`) form a provenance chain.
- **Anchors** link exploration nodes to specific assets, enabling both forward (what assets are being tested) and reverse (what intents/facts relate to an asset) queries. This powers asset coverage visualization and testing completeness.
